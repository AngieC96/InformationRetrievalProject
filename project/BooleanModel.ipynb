A lezione abbiamo visto, per le wildcard queries, che se si usano gli alberi binari una trailing wildcard \"ca*\" consiste nel un sottoalbero del termine \"ca\", purtroppo però non sono riuscita a trovare una libreria di Python per gli alberi bilanciati (ho guardato anche per BTrees) che autobilanci l'albero da sola ma che mi faccia anche accedere ai nodi per poter selezionare il sottoalbero che mi interessa. Stavo dunque pensando di continuare ad usare un Python dictionary per l'indice e creare una lista di tutti i termini che iniziano con la wildcard \"ca\", cercarli nel dizionario e poi unirli. Come implementazione delle wildcard queries andrebbe bene lo stesso?"
