#### Data structure

Python dictionaries aren’t always what you need: the most important case is where you want to store a very large mapping. When a Python dictionary is accessed, the whole dictionary has to be unpickled and brought into memory.

BTrees are a balanced tree data structure that behave like a binary tree but distribute keys throughout a number of tree nodes and each node has between $a$ and $b$ children. The nodes are stored in sorted order. Nodes are then only unpickled and brought into memory as they’re accessed, so the entire tree doesn’t have to occupy memory (unless you really are touching every single key).
