              "'Bob Sharkey  is an instructor of the 77th group of espionage agent candidates to be trained in the United States to infiltrate Nazi-occupied Europe. He is alerted that one of the students is a German agent and told to identify him or her. Sharkey is able to determine that the enemy agent is \"Bill O\\'Connell\" , who performs too well when he succeeds in a field problem designed to cause the novices to make mistakes. Sharkey\\'s boss, Charles Gibson , confirms that O\\'Connell is really Wilhelm Kuncel, one of Germany\\'s top agents but tells Sharkey to pass him, as they know Kuncel\\'s mission is to determine the date and location of the planned Allied invasion of Europe. They intend to provide Kuncel with false information to pass along to his superiors. After they complete their training and are sent to Great Britain, three of the new \"O77\" agents—Frenchwoman Suzanne de Beaumont ([[Annabella , American Jeff Lassiter  and Kuncel—are sent on missions into German-occupied France. Kuncel is briefed on a fictitious invasion of Europe through Holland, but at the last minute he asks Gibson to send Lassiter with him. Lassiter has been briefed on a different mission—to locate the factory depot for V-2 rockets that will be used against the Allied invasion ports, with Suzanne as his radio operator. Sharkey tells him about Kuncel and assigns him to accompany Kuncel into Holland but then to continue on his own mission. If Kuncel tries to follow Lassiter instead of completing his own mission, Lassiter is to kill him. However, Lassiter\\'s uneasiness apparently alerts Kuncel. When the trio parachute into Holland, Lassiter\\'s parachute fails to open; and he plummets to his death. The jumpmaster  of the B-24 Liberator transporting the group discovers that the strap to Lassiter\\'s static line was deliberately cut. Gibson and Sharkey realize that Kuncel knows that the information he was given is false and that he can identify every agent he trained with. With no time to brief another agent to be Lassiter\\'s replacement, Sharkey volunteers. Gibson protests that Sharkey knows the date and location of the invasion but reluctantly agrees. With the help of the local French resistance led by the town\\'s mayor  and his driver , Sharkey completes his mission, apprehending the collaborator who designed the V-2 depot and returning him to Great Britain. However, while intercepting Kuncel as he tries to stop the pickup airplane from taking off, Sharkey is captured. Suzanne is killed while transmitting the news to England. The Gestapo torture Sharkey, but he refuses to reveal his knowledge. Back in Great Britain, Gibson has no choice but to order a bombing raid to destroy the Gestapo headquarters and kill Sharkey before he cracks. As the bombs strike, Sharkey realizes what is happening and laughs in Kuncel\\'s face just before they both perish.'"

              "'{{Plot}} A group of college girls come in a light blue matador to Chola Picnic Village.They take a room in a hotel at that Picnic Spot.It becomes night and it is a full moon day. They go out the beach,lit a bonfire and enjoy by singing and dancing for Raathiri Nerathu Poojayil. After the song gets over,all the girls return to the Hotel. One of them is missing, that is Vasanthi. One of the girls ask among themselves where is vasanthi and one of the girl answers that she has gone for walking along with her pet dog Rita. She comes across a bell hung in a \"Pie symbol\" based structure. The bell is tied to one of the legs of the structure. She goes near it and rings it for 3 times. Then a beldam is shown who is sleeping on woods and suddenly gets up on hearing the bell sound and looks scarily on both the sides and then again goes to sleep. Then a Berlin carriage is shown in which one of the horse rubs the ground with one of its legs. Then it is shown that Vasanthi stops ringing the bell and returns back trying to lift the dog and carry it. But the dog barks and PRK is found to stand on the cocking cart with a cigar in his mouth. He looks into her eyes.Then the dog gets frightened and runs away.He sits on the footman\\'s seat of the carriage and whips it. The cart moves and Vasanthi starts running. At one point of time, PRK gets hold her hair and takes her along with him. The next scene shows Raja entering into the Chola Picnic Village.He goes through forest and comes across a Berlin Carriage.The carriage is halted aside two horses. One of the horse is shown rubbing the ground with one of its legs.Raja takes photo of it. He comes across a \"Pie Symbol\" based structure hung with a bell and tied to one of its legs. A beldam is found to sit below it.He introduces himself as Press Photographer and she stares him wildly and starts moving away from there. He says her that he has come to enquire about a murder that took place four to five days before.She doesn\\'t answer him and moves away with scare in her eyes.He calls her, she turns and he takes a photo snap of her. Then he comes across a church where he sees a father moving here and there.He introduces himself as Assistant Editor in Dhinamurasu Magazine. He enquires by saying that four to five days before a girl\\'s body was found floating in the Picnic Village\\'s Beach.He says that police reported the murder to be a suicide,regrading that he requires some clarifications.The father refuses to answer and asks him who has given him permission to enter the picnic village.In response he asks whose permission is required.The father says that there is no any sort of connection between the picnic village and the church,but since route to the church is through picnic village,a formal permission is required from the church\\'s bishop and also asks him to get out.He calls the father and takes a snap of him. That time Lakshmana,the younger brother of PRK arrives there with smoking cigarette in his mouth. Raja moves away from there. Then scene shifts to Editor Chandran\\'s house which has an embedded Photo cleaning room.They wash the photos and chandran comments that the beldam\\'s look is so weird and raja also asserts it.Additionally raja also says their behaviour is also weird and some mystery is hidden behind them.Then chandran asks raja to take the photo of the father and says that these are essentials for their project.Then chandran enquires about Vandikaran Peter to raja and raja says that he was forced to go out of the village.Chandran\\'s wife jokes about their work and offers them coffee.Then Chandran enquires to raja,how he is getting such sensational news.For that raja replies that he has a known person in alleged suspect\\'s house and her name is Uma and she is a steno.The alleged suspect is none other than MLA Saanthanathan.Phone rings in the MLA\\'s house and Velu asks her to pick the phone.She picks up the phone and says that a person name PRK wants to talk with MLA.Uma overhears their conversation through her phone.PRK says to Sattanathan that an Editor came to Picnic village to enquire about the girl\\'s death that took place last week and MLA says that he would take care of that issue. The next morning chandran while working at his office receives a phone call from an inspector who states that why does he unnecessarily investigates the girl\\'s case.For that chandran says that investigation is a press\\'s work,the police abuses him and in response chandran asks him to mind his words.Chandran asks him to put the headnews in the news paper regarding the girl\\'s murder.Raja says ask permission for a half-day as Vijay is today coming to his house from his native and also asks employment for vijay in Dhinamurasu and chandran asks him to come with his friend tomorrow.Vijay comes and raja says his work has been confirmed but he has to work without payment.Vijay accepts it and starts playing flute.
